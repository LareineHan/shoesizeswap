# :star: JavaScript web application: Shoe Size Swap :star:

Shoe Size Swap is a simple web application that allows you to convert shoe sizes between different regions (US, UK, EU, etc.). It's built with JavaScript and uses Parcel for bundling.

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you'll need to have Node.js (version 18.18.0 or higher) and npm installed on your system. If you don't have these installed, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

## Usage

1. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`. This will start a local server and automatically open your default web browser to the application. If it doesn't, you can manually navigate to the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:1234`).
2. To use the application:
   - Select the source region from the dropdown menu.
   - Choose the shoe size you want to convert from by clicking the corresponding button.
   - Select the target region from the dropdown menu.
   - The converted shoe size will appear in the middle of the page.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` directory with the bundled assets ready for deployment.
